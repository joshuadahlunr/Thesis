// Don't forget to thank your Advisor and Committee
I would like to thank my committee Dr. Frederick C. Harris Jr., Ms. Nancy LaTourrette, and Dr. Thomas Quint for their invaluable guidance throughout my graduate studies. In addition, I would like to thank Dr. Sergiu Dascalu, Dr. Sushil Louis, and Dr. Batyr Charyyev for their supplemental assistance and the opportunities they have created for me.

I would also like to extend my deepest gratitude to my mother, whose unwavering support and gentle (yet persistent) reminders kept me focused and on track throughout this journey. Her encouragement made all the difference, especially when distractions threatened to derail my progress.
