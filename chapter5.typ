== Abstract

There is a notable gap in the academic literature regarding whether users prefer certain features in modern programming language design. 
Thus, we conducted a user study with twelve C programmers, asking them to complete tasks in both standard C and a version enhanced with Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS). 
While objective metrics like completion time and error rates showed no statistically significant differences, 75% of participants preferred the UFCS version. 
However, our small sample size limits the strength of these conclusions.
