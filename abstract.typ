Despite the fact that most college graduates possess the necessary skills to assemble a compiler, few actually take on the task. One major barrier is the lack of an accessible and well-designed Intermediate Representation (IR) that can support and guide new compiler authors. 
A thoughtfully constructed IR could significantly reduce the difficulty of compiler development and encourage more individuals to engage with this domain.
To address this issue, we conduct a survey of existing compiler IR, paying particular attention to lesser-known or obscure designs that may offer untapped potential. 
In addition, we explore the feasibility of employing Entity Component Systems (ECS) to improve both performance and usability within compiler architecture.
By combining insights from these analyses with a system capable of running code across a wide range of platforms, we lay the groundwork for a new IR; specifically aimed at lowering the barrier to entry into compiler design and empowering more developers to participate in this domain.
