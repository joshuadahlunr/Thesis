abstract = {Context
Many researchers adopting systematic reviews (SRs) have also published papers discussing problems with the SR methodology and suggestions for improving it. Since guidelines for SRs in software engineering (SE) were last updated in 2007, we believe it is time to investigate whether the guidelines need to be amended in the light of recent research.
Objective
To identify, evaluate and synthesize research published by software engineering researchers concerning their experiences of performing SRs and their proposals for improving the SR process.
Method
We undertook a systematic review of papers reporting experiences of undertaking SRs and/or discussing techniques that could be used to improve the SR process. Studies were classified with respect to the stage in the SR process they addressed, whether they related to education or problems faced by novices and whether they proposed the use of textual analysis tools.
Results
We identified 68 papers reporting 63 unique studies published in SE conferences and journals between 2005 and mid-2012. The most common criticisms of SRs were that they take a long time, that SE digital libraries are not appropriate for broad literature searches and that assessing the quality of empirical studies of different types is difficult.
Conclusion
We recommend removing advice to use structured questions to construct search strings and including advice to use a quasi-gold standard based on a limited manual search to assist the construction of search stings and evaluation of the search process. Textual analysis tools are likely to be useful for inclusion/exclusion decisions and search string construction but require more stringent evaluation. SE researchers would benefit from tools to manage the SR process but existing tools need independent validation. Quality assessment of studies using a variety of empirical methods remains a major problem.}

abstract="Many applications in industrial mining rely on large manually operated trucks to transport materials around the mine. These trucks are often enormous, with very limited visibility for the driver. The combination of limited visibility and a truck with a substantial amount of weight is a recipe for accidents resulting in severe property destruction or even loss of human life. To solve these issues, we implement a simulation of a LIDAR-based proximity collision detection system to notify drivers of an imminent collision with something (or someone) outside of their field of view. We have developed a virtual reality training simulation to help train miners how to use this new system. Our simulation focuses on two main participant types: truck drivers and ground workers. This separation allows both parties to gain experience operating around the other in a low-risk virtual environment. Our final result aggregated useful features from a variety of past works and enhanced them with more immersive input and output devices.",

title="Analyzing ``Existential Dread'' on the Internet in Response to Elmo",

abstract="On January 29, 2024, Sesame Street character Elmo posted a simple tweet: ``Elmo is just checking in! How is everybody doing?'' The post received over 18,000 replies, showcasing a wide range of emotions---from grief over personal losses to lighthearted moments like sharing photos of turtles basking in the Florida sunshine. This overwhelming response captured media attention, with outlets such as CBS interpreting it as a reflection of a broader existential dread permeating online spaces, even prompting a reaction from then-President Joe Biden. This paper critically analyzes the sentiment and structure of the replies to Elmo's post, along with interactions among respondents, to explore whether discernible sentiment patterns emerge within response communities and if a general sense of existential dread is evident. Hypothetically, a sentiment analysis model would reveal distinct clusters of happy and sad posts. However, contrary to the media narrative of widespread existential dread, our analysis indicates a greater prevalence of positive responses (47{\%}) compared to negative ones (38{\%}). These findings suggest that negative emotions are outweighed by positivity in this context. Our findings reveal no overarching sentiment clusters; instead, the responses represent a complex scattered grouping of unconnected emotions.",
